      "description": "<div><p>Antoni Gaudí’s incredible buildings are a monument not just to his distinctive genius but to the spirit of a generation. The 19th-century Catalan Renaissance saw the cultural rebirth of a nation that reached its peak with the Modernisme movement. Gaudí and his contemporaries took the spirit of the times and mixed modern techniques with traditional craftsmanship to enrich Barcelona.\n\nEver since then, millions have enjoyed this beautiful architectural heritage and visited the masterpieces of Modernisme. This two-hour walking tour explores the beautiful Eixample district where the best examples can be easily discovered on foot, leading to the unfinished masterpiece of Sagrada Família. This unique building is a bridge between the twin historic highlights of Catalan culture: the medieval merchant city and the 19th-century industrial metropolis. It combines tremendous views over the city Gaudí loved with fascinating insights into his creative mind. No visit to Barcelona is complete without this UNESCO World Heritage Site, with its breathtaking spires.\n\nThe tour is much more than a series of photo opportunities (although don’t forget your camera!). We dig deep into the roots of the movement and explore the social unrest and political issues that the glossy guidebooks ignore. The result is an unforgettable portrait of one of the world’s greatest cities and a tribute to some of its most talented designers.\n\n\n\n<strong>*Average tour length. The independent guides with whom we work have your best interests in mind; while the tour usually includes the sites and stories above and lasts this long, your tour may vary depending on what your guide thinks is best for your group!</strong>\n\n<em>Take advantage of our group discount of 10% for groups of 10 or more!</em></p></div>",

Did you know that la Casa Milà, also know as La Pedrera, is a UNESCO World Heritatge Site? \n\nWe will have the opportunity to walk through the neighbors’ flat, which will be like a journey back in time. Your guide will explain how a bourgeois family lived there at the beginning of the 20th Century, as the house is completely decorated with furniture from the period. Look at all the details, as Gaudí considered even the design of the doorknobs.  \n\nDiscover the two interior courtyards of la Casa Milà: the “Patio de las Flores”, full of mural paintings that decorate this place, and the “Patio de las Mariposas”, where a butterfly is perfectly represented.  \n\nWalk through the impressive attic, known as the “Whale Attic” because of its shape, which gives you the sensation of entering the interior of a large living being. Formed by more than 270 catenary arches, it will remind you the skeleton of a whale.  \n\nWe will not forget the Warriors’ Rooftop, from where you will have beautiful 360º views of Barcelona. The name of this rooftop is due to the chimneys, which represent the warriors and guardians of la Casa Milà.</p></div>",

Its undulating balconies and the bright colors of Antoni Gaudí’s modernist architecture will remind you of the marine world.\n\nOnce inside Casa Batlló, we can immerse ourselves in the mind of Antoni Gaudí, probably Barcelona’s most important architect. As we walk through the different rooms of the house, we will discover how the Batlló family lived at the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\nWe will walk through the main floor, where we can find the great hall with unique views of Passeig de Gràcia. We will pass through the main dining room and the modernist courtyard.\n\nAccess the dragon’s rooftop through the inner courtyard, where the color blue dominates, and where looking through the glass will make you feel as if you are under the sea.\n\nOn the rooftop we will marvel with the chimneys, where Gaudí considered even the smallest details and which are made using his quintessential technique, trencadís. Moreover, this rooftop is home of a dragon, will you be able to find it? In this incredible space of the Casa Batlló you will enjoy a short time to take photos and enjoy the views.\n\nAt the end of the visit, you will have access to the Gaudí Cube, which will allow you to travel into Gaudí’s mind in a 360º experience.</p></div>",

The instructors of SM Experiences will guide you on this route with ski rackets through Rasos de Peguera of about 6-7 kilometres and 3 hours of duration. This is an easy excursion with a difference in altitude of about 300 metres where the instructor will guide you on a private excursion. In addition, the instructors will provide you with all the material and will pick you up from your hotel, so all you need to bring is your hiking skills and winter mountain clothes.</p>\n<p>Ready to get your snowshoes on in the Catalan Pyrenees?

Head up to the loft, which acted as a laundry room and cupboard, from which you can access the roof terrace. See the unusual chimneys and \"Dragon Back\" a model that depicts the dragon slain by St. George. As you wander around, notice the artist and architect's meticulous attention to detail in the door handles, skylights, and banisters. </p><p>End up in the home's entrance hall, dominated by a dramatic staircase made to look like the spine of a huge animal.
